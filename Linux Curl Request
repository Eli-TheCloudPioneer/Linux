I will be using curl to make web requests. The website I will be using as an example is my current employer website.

curl https://fhiaremodeling.com

I observe the HTML content of the web page returned to my terminal

I then save the output using -o

curl https://fhiaremodeling.com -o fhiaremodeling.html

File succesfully saved and received the following status:
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100  270k  100  270k    0     0  1102k      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 1105k

I then locate the file and open to verify for accuracy.

Now I want to analyze HTTP response headers using -I . 
I will analyze the following headers such as:Content-Type, HTTP/1.1 200 OK, Server, and Content-Length.

curl -I https://fhiaremodeling.com

****** Common HTTP Status Codes and Their Significance *******
200 OK:

Meaning: The request was successful, and the server has returned the requested resource.
Importance: This is the most common code that indicates a successful HTTP request. Verifying that interactions between the client and server are working correctly is crucial.
404 Not Found:

Meaning: The server cannot find the requested resource. This code is often seen when a URL does not exist on the server.
Importance: Identifying broken links or incorrect URL references in your application helps maintain a good user experience and SEO ranking.
301 Moved Permanently:

Meaning: This response code indicates that the requested resource has been permanently moved to a new URL, which is provided by the Location header.
Importance: This is critical for website maintenance and SEO. It ensures that users and search engines are directed to the correct URL, preserving the site's link equity.
